# DataMiningProject

## Project created to show understanding of various different types of tests that could be preformed on a set of data with Python. 

## Part A uses basic Bag of Words classification such as Naive Bates, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Random Forrest and SVM.

## Part B uses Keras to apple different filters and to create Neural Networks.

## The ExtraCredit used Hyperparameter Optimization.
